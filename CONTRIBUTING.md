# Contributions

This is a toy project that I started to learn Phoenix LiveView. 

Most of the app features are based on [Lichess.org](https://lichess.org/), (with piece style matching the diagram in README.md) so if you want to see how a feature will work, go to Lichess and see it live there.

The design of the app will also eventually be influenced by Lichess (especially the playing area), though not a 100% copy.

## What to contribute 

- Implement Features
- Fix Bugs 
- Add unit and integration tests
- If you have an eye for design, give the project some cool styles
- Add function typespec and documentation
- Refactoring
- Help with deployment


## How to contribute

Since currently it's Hacktoberfest 2022 I am opening up this project for contributions.

All contributions are most welcome, no matter if you are Elixir beginner or pro, or Phoenix noob or expert. 

Just choose an issue from [this list of isses](https://github.com/AliNisarAhmed/tictactwo/issues), comment on it to say that you are working on it, and start working.

Once done, open a PR. 

There's also a [project board](https://github.com/users/AliNisarAhmed/projects/16) from where you can pick up tickets, create an issue for them, and add `hacktoberfest` label.
